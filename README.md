Repository with the solution for the Nubank Data Scientist puzzle.
## Setup instructions
### Conda environment
I used an Anaconda environment and generated a `.yml` file with the necessary dependencies. Just make sure you have a `conda` distribution ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), etc.) and run the following command to install the environment:

  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```
    
After creating the environment, run `conda activate nuenv` to activate it. With the environment activated, run `jupyter notebook`.
